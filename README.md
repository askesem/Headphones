Headphones
==========

Re-Designing a tool for function. 
For this project I designed a contraption for earbud headphones to be able to wear them over the head. 
The materials used are thermal and flexible PLA, which adds to the interaction and movement of the tool.
All parts are easily sepearated and put back together.
